--CUSTOMER REPORT
/* 
Purpose:
		- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
	1. Gather essential fields such as names, ages and transaction details.
	2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, REGULAR, NEW) and age groups.
	3. Aggregates customers-level metrics:
		- total orders
		- total sales
		- total quantity
		- total products
		- lifespan (in months)
	4. Calculate valuable KPIs:
	 - recency (months since last order)
	 - average order value
	 - average monthly spend
